/* 
Polymorphism in C++

It simply means many forms.
It refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms, 
which are when the behavior of the same object or function is different in different contexts. 

Two types of polymorphism:

1. Compile time polymorphism: 
    ** Polymorphism achieved at compile-time.
    ** Also referred to as static or early binding.
    ** It is implemented by:
           a. Function Overloading
           b. Operator Overloading
    ** The function to be invoked is decided at the compile time only.


2.  Run time polymorphism:
     ** Polymorphism achieved at run-time.
     ** Also referred to as late binding or dynamic-binding.
     ** It is implemented by Function overriding using virtual funcitons
     ** when functions are resolved at runtime rather than compile time. When a call to 
        an overridden method is resolved dynamically at runtime rather than compile time.
